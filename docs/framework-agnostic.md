**StaticShield is framework agnostic**

[StaticShield](https://staticshield.vercel.app) works with any framework. So, you can use it with your
framework of choice.
StaticShield simply works with good ol' HTML too.

Prebuilt boilerplates and examples of
StaticShield with various different frameworks can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/lalit2005/staticshield-examples)

Some of the frameworks you can currently find in the repo are

- Nextjs
- Vuejs
- Nuxtjs
- HTML
- Svelte
- SvelteKit
- Gatsby (_In progress_)
- React (_In progress_)
- Preact (_In progress_)

If you don't find your favourite framework in the docs, just drop a word
[here](https://staticshield.vercel.app/contact). Or follow along to get it right yourself (it's really really easy).
