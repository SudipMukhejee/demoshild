# StaticShield

[StaticShield](https://staticshield.vercel.app) helps you password protect websites, <u>without the need of writing a single line of code</u>. You will have to just
paste in a `code block` in the head of your document that StaticShield provides.

With StaticShield, you can password protect pages on a per page basis, or simply just your whole app.

You can browse through the StaticShield docs to explore how it integrates easily with various frameworks such as NextJS, VueJS, React, Gatsby,
NuxtJS, Vanilla HTML-CSS-JS, etcâ€¦

Even if you don't find your framework of choice in the documentation, you can just contribute to it on GitHub. All you need to know
is how to add some tags to the `head` tag in the final rendered HTML page.
